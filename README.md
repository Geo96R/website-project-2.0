# George DevOps Portfolio
######### Out of date project, new one being made #########

My Terminal/Cyberpunk website showing off DevOps skills with real-time data streams and interactive stuff.
i wanted to merge imagination creation my innovation and skills from the day to day work to encapsulate how i feel in the field, how i think,
a bit of hopefull inspirations to try do things that are perhaps at times beyond my scope but studying is what i do almost all the time.
inspiring to be better and share my knowledge if can is why i made this, While i don't have 500years of experience from the year 1525(Sorry was born too late) i can still make up with the passion i have for the field for the learning.
Enjoy what i made, be happy be healthy work hard and believe in your self.

**Current Version: v1.4.0** - Migrated from Nginx Ingress to Contour + Gateway API, added Grafana Cloud monitoring, ArgoCD GitOps demonstration, and updated to Next.js 16

Note any and all here may be subject for future change if i want to scrape and redo stuff this why ill have versions you can use wayback archive(if they index this beautiful creation) to see previous version
i will try keep it updated as much as possible wether it is new docker/k8s versions or next js. but life happens so be strong! and google away

## Why I Switched from Nginx Ingress to Contour + Gateway API

I migrated from Nginx Ingress Controller to Contour with Gateway API because [Ingress NGINX is being retired in March 2026](https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/11/12/ingress-nginx-retirement/). After that date, there won't be any more releases, bugfixes, or security updates. Since I'm building this to showcase modern DevOps practices, I figured it makes sense to use the technology that's actually the future of Kubernetes networking.

Gateway API is the official replacement for Ingress it's more powerful, has better separation of concerns, and is actively developed. Contour is a solid Gateway controller that uses Envoy under the hood, which gives me better performance and more features than Nginx.

**What changed:**
- Replaced Nginx Ingress Controller with Contour (controller) + Envoy (proxy)
- Migrated from Ingress API to Gateway API (Gateway, HTTPRoute resources)
- Traffic now flows: Internet → Envoy → My App (instead of Nginx → App)

**What I kept:**
- The `k8s-demo/` folder still has Nginx Ingress examples for anyone who wants to follow along and recreate things on their own. Just know that Nginx Ingress won't receive any updates after March 2026, so if you're starting fresh, I'd recommend going straight to Gateway API.
but make sure you either do it in a Dev/Staging env or get ready for few mins of downtime depending your application as this change will need ingress nginx down

## Quick Start
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.9.0+ 
- Docker (optional)
- Git
- Enviorment(Server/PC) for the bare minimum of 4-8gb ram (Storage wise dont need much no database)

## Live Features

- **AWS Infrastructure**: Real-time service health and region status
- **Google Cloud**: Platform status and service monitoring
- **Radio**: 300+ international radio stations with genre filtering
- **Learning**: DevOps topics with Wikipedia integration
- **CV**: Interactive professional profile with skills showcase

## Configuration
### Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV=production` (optional)
- `PORT=3000` (optional, defaults to 3000)

### API Endpoints
- `/api/aws-health` - AWS service health data
- `/api/google-health` - Google Cloud status
- `/api/radio-stations` - Radio station data
- `/api/wikipedia` - Learning content

## Deployment

### Automated CI/CD (Recommended)
This project uses GitHub Actions for deployments:
- **Docker Build**: Automatically builds and pushes to GHCR on push to main
- **Kubernetes Deploy**: Auto-deploys via `kubectl rollout restart` after image push
- **Terraform**: Manages Cloudflare DNS, WAF, and SSL automatically

**Note on ArgoCD:** I've included an ArgoCD GitOps setup in `k8s-demo/argocd/` as a demonstration. I'm not using it for actual deployments here because my production `k8s/` directory is kept private (not in Git) for security reasons, which makes GitOps impractical in a public repo. If you're setting this up in your own environment with a private repository, you can use ArgoCD for full GitOps automation and remove the `kubectl rollout restart` step from the GitHub Actions workflow. Jenkins works also

See `.github/workflows/` for pipeline configs and `k8s-demo/argocd/` for GitOps demonstration.

### Infrastructure Management
Cloudflare is managed via Terraform:
```bash
cd infra/cloudflare
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

See `infra/cloudflare/README.md` for setup instructions.

### Manual Deployment

**Docker:**
```bash
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t your-registry/website-project:latest .
docker push your-registry/website-project:latest
```

**Kubernetes (Nginx Ingress example):**
```bash
# Install Nginx Ingress Controller
kubectl apply -f k8s-demo/nginx-ingress.yaml

# Apply your app
kubectl apply -f k8s-demo/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s-demo/service.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s-demo/ingress.yaml

# Restart deployment
kubectl rollout restart deployment/website-project
```

**Note:** The example above uses Nginx Ingress (available in `k8s-demo/`) for simplicity. In production, I'm using Contour + Gateway API, but those configs are kept private. If you want to migrate to Gateway API yourself, check out the [Gateway API documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) and [Contour documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/).

**Documentation:**
- [Gateway API Documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/)
- [Contour Documentation](https://projectcontour.io/docs/)
- [Ingress NGINX Retirement Announcement](https://www.kubernetes.dev/blog/2025/11/12/ingress-nginx-retirement/)
